# Custom QR codes

Create a custom QR code that encodes some text, e.g. a URL and shows some text, e.g.: your name.

## How to use

You can open this repo in codespaces and it will install the prerequisites and be ready to run at the terminal, with the following command.

```bash
python qr_gen.py -e "https://github.com/phoughton" -v "Pete Houghton" -o "myqr.png"
```

Don't forget to change the details to be yours and to put the text in the double quotes.

In Github Codespaces a right mouse click will give you the option to download the image.
